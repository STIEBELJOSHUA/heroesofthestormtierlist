/ What the fuck did you just fucking say  \
| about me, you little bitch? Ill have    |
| you know I graduated top of my class in |
| the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved   |
| in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda,  |
| and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I  |
| am trained in gorilla warfare and Im    |
| the top sniper in the entire US armed   |
| forces. You are nothing to me but just  |
| another target. I will wipe you the     |
| fuck out with precision the likes of    |
| which has never been seen before on     |
| this Earth, mark my fucking words. You  |
| think you can get away with saying that |
| shit to me over the Internet\? Think    |
| again, fucker. As we speak I am         |
| contacting my secret network of spies   |
| across the USA and your IP is being     |
| traced right now so you better prepare  |
| for the storm, maggot. The storm that   |
| wipes out the pathetic little thing you |
| call your life. Youre fucking dead,     |
| kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I  |
| can kill you in over seven hundred      |
| ways, and thats just with my bare       |
| hands. Not only am I extensively        |
| trained in unarmed combat, but I have   |
| access to the entire arsenal of the     |
| United States Marine Corps and I will   |
| use it to its full extent to wipe your  |
| miserable ass off the face of the       |
| continent, you little shit. If only you |
| could have known what unholy            |
| retribution your little \"clever\"      |
| comment was about to bring down upon    |
| you, maybe you would have held your     |
| fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you    |
| didnt, and now youre paying the price,  |
| you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all |
| over you and you will drown in it.      |
| Youre fucking dead, kiddo. Also,        |
\ Epstien didnt kill himself. Mooo!       /

Q:Why does this website look so bad??<br>
Because im shit at web design.<b<br><br><br>

A: Idk, it was cheap and funny. I stole the idea from <a href="https://cock.li">*Cock.li*</a>, but theirs is national.shitposting.agency.<br>
For some reason they only registered shitposting.agency and used national as a subdomain, idk why.<br><br>
