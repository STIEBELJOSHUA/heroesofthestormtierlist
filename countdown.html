/ What the fuck did you just fucking say  \
| about me, you little bitch? Ill have    |
| you know I graduated top of my class in |
| the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved   |
| in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda,  |
| and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I  |
| am trained in gorilla warfare and Im    |
| the top sniper in the entire US armed   |
| forces. You are nothing to me but just  |
| another target. I will wipe you the     |
| fuck out with precision the likes of    |
| which has never been seen before on     |
| this Earth, mark my fucking words. You  |
| think you can get away with saying that |
| shit to me over the Internet\? Think    |
| again, fucker. As we speak I am         |
| contacting my secret network of spies   |
| across the USA and your IP is being     |
| traced right now so you better prepare  |
| for the storm, maggot. The storm that   |
| wipes out the pathetic little thing you |
| call your life. Youre fucking dead,     |
| kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I  |
| can kill you in over seven hundred      |
| ways, and thats just with my bare       |
| hands. Not only am I extensively        |
| trained in unarmed combat, but I have   |
| access to the entire arsenal of the     |
| United States Marine Corps and I will   |
| use it to its full extent to wipe your  |
| miserable ass off the face of the       |
| continent, you little shit. If only you |
| could have known what unholy            |
| retribution your little \"clever\"      |
| comment was about to bring down upon    |
| you, maybe you would have held your     |
| fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you    |
| didnt, and now youre paying the price,  |
| you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all |
| over you and you will drown in it.      |
| Youre fucking dead, kiddo. Also,        |
\ Epstien didnt kill himself. Mooo!       /

<h1 style="color:#39ff14;">Countdown to the end of (UNIX) time</h1> 
<p>
A countdown to 3:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038, when unix time will cease to function 
on 32 bit systems. This is because unix time is the number of seconds since the unix epoch 
(1 January 1970), and in early 2038, the number of seconds since the epoch will reach 
2,147,483,647 or 1111111111111111111111111111111 in binary. 
See the problem?
